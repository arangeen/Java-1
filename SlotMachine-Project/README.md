Slot Machine Program
 Hey, my name is Ahmad Rangeen. This program called, "Slot Machine", 
 askes the user how much money they want to bet. You can chose 
 from $1 - $100. If you chose 0, then the program ends. IF you chose a 
 negative number, the program will tell you to choose again until you put a number 0 - 100.
 After you decide how much you want to bet ( 1- 100), the machine will pull for you and
 there will be three slots next to each other. Each slot can have a combination 
 of "BAR", "7", "cherries" or "space". If you get this combination in order,
 "Cherries", "{anything but Cherries]" "{Anything}" , you can win 5x the amount that you bet.
 If you get, "cherries”, "cherries"  "[not cherries]", you can win  15 × the amount that you bet.
 If you get,"cherries", "cherries", "cherries" , you can win 30 × the amount that you bet. 
 If you get, "BAR", "BAR" , "BAR" , you can win 50 x the amount that you bet.
 If you get "7", "7" , "7", you can win 100 x the amount that you bet. Whenever your done playing, just put in 0.
